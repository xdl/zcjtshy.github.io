  </div>
  <div class="uk-flex">
    We believe everyone has a story to tell.
  </div>
  <div class="uk-flex uk-width-2-3@m uk-margin-top">
    Yet, many stories are untold, hidden, or suppressed.
  </div>
  <div class="uk-flex uk-width-2-3@m uk-margin-top">
    Soul Relics is an online platform on storytelling, objects and mental health. We are dedicated to respond to these issues using creative media and stories.
  </div>
  <div class="uk-flex uk-width-2-3@m uk-margin-top">
    We anchor our memories with objects. By creating an open platform for connections to form between our individual stories, and letting each person use objects to express a fragment of past/ present personal account of mental ill health and recovery, we hope to create a collective message that transcends barriers between people, and challenges the stigma surrounding mental health.
  </div>
  <div class="uk-flex uk-width-2-3@m uk-margin-top">
    Ultimately, we hope the platform will capture both unique experiences and common themes. We wish to provide a new way for people to tell and understand othersâ€™ stories.

  <div class="uk-flex uk-width-2-3@m uk-margin-top">
    If you agree with the cause, please read our stories, and/or send yours. You can also look at the vision statement on Medium .

  <div class="uk-flex uk-width-2-3@m uk-margin-top">
    It is a gallery of photos of objects and personal stories that are related to a difficult time of your lives (A period of mental ill health); and/or something that helped you work towards recovery. That object can be anything of personal significance, or/and represent institutional barrier to mental health care, etc.
