	<p>  
 	1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any given year. However, although there is an increase in awareness of mental health, there is still a lack of understanding about the issue.

		We believe everyone has a story to tell. <br/>
		Yet, many stories are untold, hidden, or suppressed. <br/>
		Soul Relics is an online platform on storytelling, objects and mental health. We are dedicated to respond to these issues using creative media and stories.<br/>
		We anchor our memories with objects. By creating an open platform for connections to form between our individual stories, and letting each person use objects to express a fragment of past/ present personal account of mental ill health and recovery, we hope to create a collective message that transcends barriers between people, and challenges the stigma surrounding mental health.  <br/>
		Ultimately, we hope the platform will capture both unique experiences and common themes. We wish to provide a new way for people to tell and understand others’ stories. <br/> 
		If you agree with the cause, please read our stories, and/or send yours.

		<p>In brief, the founder went to the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb in summer 2015 and was amazed by how powerful and relatable objects and story-telling were. While we live in a society that focus on interpersonal relationships, have we paid enough attention to our relationships with ourselves? That planted the seeds of Soul Relics. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="tab-3" class="tab-panel">
		The end-goal of this project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) – “Wellbeing”. </br>
		For the first time, The UN is recognising the importance of mental health. </br>
		Target 3.4 requests that countries: “By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.” Target 3.5 requests that countries: “Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.”</br>
		Our vision is to have a physical and visual museum that uses storytelling through objects as the visualisation, memory association and relational tool, and categorising the stories to understand and drive social change. </br>
		If this works, imagine this concept being widened into other complex social issues. We can use objects and story-telling as a tool to express injustices such as sexism, violence, racism, poverty, unsustainability etc., things that have become authors of our own stories. </br>
		<h5> There is a need for story-telling. </h5> Story-telling is powerful in personal discovery and recovery as confirmed from research. Using stories as an alternative narrative to can help re-construct one’s identity and de-pathologise mental health issues. Some people do not know the appropriate channels to voice their struggles anonymously.</br> 
		<h5> There is a need for creative story-telling and expression. </h5> Objects have been used as a form of story-telling for people who broke up, sex workers, homeless people, and older adults, but we have not heard anyone who uses it for mental health. </br>
		<h5> There is a need for story-listening. </h5> There are lots of blogs and forums on mental health but they are scattered and not themed. General public may not be motivated to search and read them one by one. With a unified platform of story collection using objects, public can view the stories and objects and can relate to them. This is easier for the public to understand as drawings can be too abstract for some. With this idea coming live, it can help break down stigma and gives new meanings to the objects. </br>
		<h5> There is a need for research and cross-disciplinary work. </h5> This project has various theoretical underpinnings that span across narrative psychology, anthropology, museum heritage studies (on object handling) and creative writing. Voices and stories are more powerful when they are presented in one platform. However, very little research has been conducted on this form of recovery-focused expression. This project can form the basis for this type of research. </br>
		<h5> Mental health is everyone’s business. </h5> We hope that this will improve the contributor’s wellbeing by writing the stories in a different way, and the public can understand them and one another better. </br>
